# Orange Pi 5 Pro Gaming (Yocto Edition)

*Bringing Desktop-class gaming to the RK3588 SBC.*

Most distributions for the Orange Pi 5 are bloated with background services. My Yocto-based image is stripped to the bone, redirecting all CPU/GPU resources to the game.

## Key Features:
* **UI:** RetroArch integrated as the default desktop environment.
* **Compatibility:** Pre-configured **Box64, Wine, and DXVK** for running x86/Windows games on ARM.
* **Optimization:** Custom kernel patches for lower input lag and optimized Mali GPU drivers.
* **Performance:** Up to 15-20% better FPS compared to standard Debian/Armbian builds in CPU-bound emulators.

> **Interested in the Full Image?** I offer a premium "Plug-and-Play" image with expanded emulator support and custom game prefixes. [Contact me via Email](mailto:embedded.bitbake@gmail.com) for details.  
> *Disclaimer: All products are sold as OS environments. Users are responsible for providing their own legally obtained game ROMs and BIOS files.*
