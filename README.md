# EmbeddedBitbake: High-Performance Custom Linux Solutions

Welcome to the official repository of **EmbeddedBitbake**. I specialize in creating ultra-optimized, purpose-built Yocto Project distributions for ARM and FPGA-based hardware. 

Whether you need a **lean gaming OS** that outperforms standard distributions or an **industrial-grade BSP** for mission-critical hardware, I provide tailor-made images designed for performance, stability, and speed.
